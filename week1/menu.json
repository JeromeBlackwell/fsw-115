Scrape sides of bowl often. Add 2 eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, and scraping down the bowl. Add half of flour and baking powder and beat to blend. Next, add the remaining 2 eggs, one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Continue scraping down sides of bowl, often. Now add the remaining flour and beat until blended.",
        "directions1": "Combine instant coffee and baking soda in small bowl. Pour into date mixture, stirring to dissolve coffee granules. It will froth slightly. Add the date mixture to batter and mix well until evenly combined. Pour the batter into prepared pan. I have found that placing about 1 cup of batter, into another small pan works also. The cake doesn’t rise as high, which means there is no need to level the top. Place on rimmed baking sheet and bake until tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let the cake cool in the pan. After it has cooled, you can level off the top of the cake if necessary. Carefully remove the cake from the dish, then level and remove the top. I like using a cake leveler. Place the cake back into the pan. Poke holes all over the cake with a skewer or toothpick. Bring cream, brown sugar and butter to boil in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer sauce until reduced to 1 3/4 cups (12 oz), stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. If adding the Drambuie, add it after taking the sauce off the heat. When cake is cool and caramel sauce is still warm, but not too hot, pour about half of the sauce over the cake. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate, without covering. After an hour or so, when the sauce has become firm, cover the dessert with cling film (once cool the plastic won’t stick to it.)",

In a separate medium sized bowl stir 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Use a fork to make fine and crumbly. On parchment lined baking sheet sprinkle on the strawberry crumbles. Then sprinkle on the vanilla crumbles, ever so slightly mixing them by hand. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes at 350 F. Do not stir at all. Remove from oven and let cool completely (at least 1 hour). If they feel warm, place the baking sheet in fridge or wait another 30 minutes. Crumble into an airtight container to store. Makes 3 cups of strawberry shortcake crumbles. In a large mixing bowl use an electric mixer (like KitchenAid) to beat the heavy whipping cream and powder sugar together until very stiff peaks form. Set aside in fridge. In a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer beat the cream cheese until creamy and no lumps. Add the sweetened condensed milk and beat another minute or so until thoroughly combined. Add the pureed strawberries and mix well. Pour the strawberry mixture into the whipped cream and stir until well combined. Pour into prepared 10-inch pie crust (9-inch is okay, but you will have some leftover that will not fit). Freeze for 4 to 5 hours. When ready to serve, remove from freezer and let thaw about 10 minutes. Layer on strawberry shortcake crumbles and serve,"
